There are many ways to get data into your New Relic account. Any New Relic user can use any of our data ingest methods to report data to our platform.

## New Relic-built agents and integrations [#integrations]

When you enable New Relic solutions like [APM](/docs/apm), [browser monitoring](/docs/browser), [mobile monitoring](/docs/mobile-monitoring), [infrastructure monitoring](/docs/infrastructure), or any of our wide array of [integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations), by default you'll receive data from your monitored applications, hosts, services, or other entities.

Some options for getting started: 

* Log into [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com) and click **Add more data** to get some guidance on setting up New Relic solutions.
* To browse our solutions, see [New Relic integrations](https://newrelic.com/integrations).

## Report custom data [#custom-data]

If you need to report data that our [agents and integrations](#integrations) don't provide, we have tools that will allow you to bring in any type of data you need. To learn more, see [Intro to custom data](/docs/telemetry-data-platform/custom-data/intro-custom-data).
