    True observability is the power of knowing what’s happening in your digital system, and why, at any time. New Relic's observability solutions give you the whole picture of the hundreds of applications and services you run simultaneously, and allow you to give context to the performance of your system. 

    Use our tools to visualize, analyze, and troubleshoot your entire software stack in one connected interface. You'll get rich analytics, coupled with a curated user experience.
